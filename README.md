# Custom Marketing Blog

## Description
The purpose of the custom blog is to create a dynamic website where the user can enter in blog posts with a corresponding username, title and post content to have it displayed on their personal blog. This website was built for marketing students in mind. The website can be changed from either dark mode or light mode by hitting the corresponding symbols in the top right corner ("☾" or "☼" respectively). The viewer can also preview current blog posts by clicking the 'Posts' button. 

Comments have been left to show code done in-detail. By separating each section with comments, it allows the viewer to jump to each section in a streamlined manner.
